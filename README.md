Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client Artemis Financial wanted their codebase looked at and made sure that there were no security flaws within that code base as the client deals with finacnial information for many people and companies.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

One thing I did well was implimenting code error handling which is important to make sure code is secure and any issues can be resolved. It is important to make code secure because unsecure code can lead to many issues for the company and can possibly shut a company down if the problem is big enough. If someone is able to get into important data especially when dealing with a financial company the attacker can steal oney from clients which can tank a companies reputation causing them to lose buissness and possibly ruin a comapanies stock price which can cause them to shut down. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One part that I found challanging was trying to impliment the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram into the code base and using the different areas in order to have a more secure code without any vulnurabilites. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

One way to increase security is to have any type of input validation. This code base did not have any inputs so in the future it would be important to impliment this in order to avoid any type of cross scripting attacks or any SQL injections.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I was able to use the descrepency report in order to identify any security issues that were introduce. Another way to make the code more secure is to make sure any platforms, dependencys, or plugins are up to date which can eliminate any descrepencies. After refactoring I used the report again and the only descepencies I found were false positives and due to services being out of date.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

One of the most useful was the descrepency report as it can be a good tool in order to see any issues that may be hard to identify by just reading through the code base. It can also help becuase it offers suggestions as to how to fix the security issues.
